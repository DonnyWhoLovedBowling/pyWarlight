"""
Example of how to enable enhanced verification and monitoring for PPO training

This shows how to enable various debugging and monitoring features:
1. Input verification between single-sample and batch inference  
2. Comprehensive gradient analysis and monitoring
3. Weight change tracking
4. Action distribution analysis  
5. Adaptive PPO epochs based on gradient norms

# Example usage in your main training script:

    from src.agents.RLGNNAgent import RLGNNAgent
    
    # Create agent with enhanced verification
    agent = RLGNNAgent()
    
    # Enable all verification systems for debugging
    agent.enable_verification(
        enable_batch_verification=True,   # Verify inputs match between inference and training
        enable_ppo_verification=True      # Enable comprehensive PPO training analysis
    )
