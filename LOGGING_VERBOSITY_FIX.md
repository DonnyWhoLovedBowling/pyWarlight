# PPO Logging Verbosity Fix

## Problem Fixed
The PPO verification system was printing verbose output regardless of the `detailed_logging` configuration setting.

## Changes Made

### 1. PPOVerification.py Updates
Updated all print statements in PPO verification methods to respect the `detailed_logging` flag:

- `verify_structural_integrity()` - Wrapped verbose prints with `if self.config.detailed_logging:`
- `verify_model_outputs()` - Wrapped shape and sample prints with detailed_logging check
- `verify_single_vs_batch_inference()` - Made output conditional on detailed_logging
- `verify_buffer_data_integrity()` - Wrapped detailed prints with logging check
- `verify_action_data()` - Made verification output conditional
- `verify_old_log_probs()` - Wrapped sample output with logging check
- `analyze_gradients()` - Made detailed analysis conditional on detailed_logging
- `analyze_weight_changes()` - Wrapped detailed output with logging check
- `analyze_action_distribution()` - Made entropy analysis output conditional

**Key principle**: Only ERROR and WARNING messages still print unconditionally (they indicate actual problems). All detailed diagnostic output now respects the `detailed_logging` flag.

### 2. Training Config Update
Updated `residual_model_config()` in `training_config.py`:
```python
config.verification.detailed_logging = False  # Quiet logging to reduce verbosity
```

## Usage

### For Quiet Operation (Default Now)
```python
# Use residual_model config - now has quiet logging
config = get_config("residual_model")
```

### For Verbose Debugging
```python
# Use debug config or manually enable
config = get_config("debug")
# OR
config = get_config("residual_model")
config.verification.detailed_logging = True
```

## What You'll Still See
- Error messages (NaN detection, gradient explosion warnings)
- Progress indicators and training metrics
- Important status updates
- Problem diagnostics (when issues are detected)

## What's Now Quiet
- Tensor shape information
- Sample values from logits/features  
- Detailed structural verification output
- Per-episode verification details
- Layer-wise gradient analysis details
- Weight change analysis details
- Action distribution entropy details

## Testing Your Current Setup
Your residual model should now run much quieter while still providing:
- Essential training progress
- Error detection and warnings
- Performance metrics
- Entropy monitoring (when issues detected)

The logging verbosity issue is now resolved!
